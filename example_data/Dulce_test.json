Agent Alex Mercer, unfailingly determined on paper, seemed dwarfed by the enormity of the sterile briefing room where Paranormal Military Squad's elite convened. With dulled eyes, he scanned the projectors outlining their impending odyssey into Operation: Dulce., The thrumming of monitors cast a stark contrast to the rigid silence enveloping the group. Agent Alex Mercer, unfailingly determined on paper, seemed dwarfed by the enormity of the sterile briefing room where Paranormal Military Squad's elite convened. With dulled eyes, he scanned the projectors outlining their impending odyssey into Operation: Dulce.\n\n“I assume, Agent Mercer, you’re not having second thoughts?” It was Taylor Cruz’s voice, laced with an edge that demanded attention.\n\nAlex flickered a strained smile, still thumbing his folder's corner. 'Of course not, Agent Cruz. Just trying to soak in all the details.' The compliance in his tone was unsettling, even to himself.\n\nJordan Hayes, perched on the opposite side of the table, narrowed their eyes but offered a supportive nod. 'Details are imperative. We’ll need your clear-headedness down there, Mercer.'\n\nA comfortable silence, the kind that threaded between veterans of shared secrets, lingered briefly before Sam Rivera, never one to submit to quiet, added, 'I’ve combed through the last transmission logs. If anyone can make sense of the anomalies, it’s going to be the two of you.'\n\nTaylor snorted dismissively. 'Focus, people. We have protocols for a reason. Speculation is counter-productive.' The words 'counter-productive' seemed to hang in the air, a tacit reprimand directed at Alex.\n\nFeeling the weight of his compliance conflicting with his natural inclination to leave no stone unturned, Alex straightened in his seat. 'I agree, Agent Cruz. Protocol is paramount,' he said, meeting Taylor's steely gaze. It was an affirmation, but beneath it lay layers of unspoken complexities that would undoubtedly unwind with time.\n\nAlex's submission, though seemingly complete, didn't escape Jordan, who tilted their head ever so slightly, their eyes revealing a spark of understanding. They knew well enough the struggle of aligning personal convictions with overarching missions. As everyone began to collect their binders and prepare for departure, a quiet resolve took form within Alex, galvanized by the groundwork laid by their interactions. He may have spoken in compliance, but his determination had merely taken a subtler form — one that wouldn't surrender so easily to the forthcoming shadows.",
