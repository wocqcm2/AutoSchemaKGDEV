The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie.  It is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition.  The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks.  Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name.  The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox.  The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series.  Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and \"The Simpsons Pinball Party\" (2003).

The earliest documented prosecution of gender-based/targeted crimes is from 1474 when Sir Peter von Hagenbach was convicted for rapes committed by his troops.  However, the trial was unsuccessful in indicting Sir von Hagenbach with the charge of rape because the war in which the rapes occurred was \"undeclared\" and thus the rapes were only considered illegal.  Gender-targeted crimes continued to be prosecuted, but it was not until after World War II when an international criminal tribunal- the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (Tokyo Tribunal)- were officers charged for being responsible of the gender-targeted crimes (particularly rape) and other crimes against humanity.  Despite the various rape charges, the Charter of the Tokyo Tribunal did not make references to rape, and rape was considered as subordinate to other war crimes.  This is also the situation for other tribunals that followed, but with the establishments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), there was more attention to the prosecution of gender-targeted crimes with each of the statutes explicitly referring to rape and other forms of gender-targeted violence.",

While people unfamiliar with hip hop culture often use the expression \"hip hop\" to refer exclusively to hip hop music (also called \"rap\"), Hip hop is characterized by nine distinct elements or expressive realms, of which hip hop music is only four elements (rapping, djaying, beatboxing and breaking).  Afrika Bambaataa of the hip hop collective Zulu Nation outlined the pillars of hip hop culture, coining the terms: \"rapping\" (also called MCing or emceeing), a rhythmic vocal rhyming style (orality); DJing (and turntablism), which is making music with record players and DJ mixers (aural/sound and music creation); b-boying/b-girling/breakdancing (movement/dance); and graffiti art, which he called \"aerosol writin'\", although many say that the graffiti that hip hop adopted had been around years earlier, and had nothing to do with hip hop culture.  (visual art).  Other elements of hip hop subculture and arts movements beyond the main four are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement (intellectual/philosophical); beatboxing, a percussive vocal style; street entrepreneurship; hip hop language; and hip hop fashion and style, among others.",

Alongside descriptions of historical events, the stories often contain mythical elements.  Pantun were originally not written down, the bards often being illiterate and in many cases blind.  Originally the performances had a sacred character, as was clear from the offerings made at the beginning of the recitation and also from the content of the introductory part of the story, called rajah, which was an invocatory song, imploring the help of divine figures to ward off bad influences.  The linguistic form of the pantun was not strictly fixed, however the dominant form employed in most pantun is the octosyllabic verse.

Williams, as U.S. Senator, authored and supported legislation that allowed the U.S. military to be deployed in Reconstruction southern states to allow for an orderly process of readmittance into the United States.  Williams was the first presidential Cabinet member to be appointed from the Pacific Coast.  As attorney general under President Ulysses S. Grant, Williams continued the prosecutions that shut down the Ku Klux Klan.  He had to contend with controversial election disputes in Reconstructed southern states.  President Grant and Williams legally recognized P. B. S. Pinchback as the first African American state governor.  Williams ruled that the \"Virginius\", a gun-running ship captured by Spain during the Virginius Affair, did not have the right to bear the U.S. flag.  However, he argued that Spain did not have the right to execute American crew members.  Nominated for Supreme Court Chief Justice by President Grant, Williams failed to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate primarily due to Williams' removal of A. C.

She was from the United New Democratic Party (UNDP) as a member of the Korean National Assembly (representative) for Ilsan-gab, and is a graduate of Ewha Womans University in Seoul with a degree in French literature.  She resigned as Prime Minister on March 7, 2007 and declared her presidential candidacy.  But she did not succeed in the nominations.  In 2008 she ran for parliament, but was not elected.  However, in January 2012 she was elected leader of the main oppositional Democratic United Party (DUP) before the April legislative elections and became a member of parliament.  But the liberals did not manage to defeat the ruling Saenuri Party and Han stepped down as party leader in April 2012.  In August 2015, Han was convicted of receiving illegal donations at the amount of 900 million KRW, and sentence to two years in prison.  She is ineligible to run for public office for ten years after her prison term.  She became the first former prime minister of the Republic of Korea to serve a prison time.",

Japanese rule of Korea was the outcome of a process that began with the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1876, whereby a complex coalition of the Meiji government, military, and business officials sought to integrate Korea both politically and economically into the Empire of Japan.  A major stepping-stone towards the Japanese occupation of Korea was the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1905, in which the then-Korean Empire was declared a protectorate of Japan.  The annexation of Korea by Japan was set up in the Japan–Korea Treaty of 1910, which was never actually signed by the Korean Regent, Gojong.",

In 1945, the decision was made to have American Marines forces oversee Japanese surrender and disarmament south of the 38th parallel and the Soviet Union would facilitate the change of power to the north.  At the time there was no political motivation and seemed to be a logical and convenient plan of action.  The original agreement and intent was to create a unified and independent Korea out of the post Japanese occupation era.  Instead each side of the 38th parallel established its own government under the influence of the occupational country; the United States in South Korea and the Soviet Union in North Korea.  Both new Korean governments discredited the other and claimed to be the only legitimate political system.  Tensions between the North and South escalated and each side began to petition foreign powers for resources and support.  South Korea wanted weapons and supplies from Truman and the United States government while North Korea sought help from Stalin and the Soviet Union.  The United States was still war weary from the disruptive World War II campaign and refused South Korea's request for weapons and troops.  North Korea convinced the Soviet Union to supply them with the weapons and support they requested.  This decision coincided with the United States withdrawing the last remaining combat troops from South Korea.  North Korea saw its opportunity and attacked South Korean forces at the 38th parallel on June 25, 1950 and thus initiating the Korean War.",

Originally, the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor was split into five individual unions of bakers, cigar makers, printers, tailors, and carpenters.  Now they represent over 300 unions, about 800,000 people, throughout Los Angeles County, making it the second largest in the country.  “A survey published in December 2003 showed that the three largest unions in the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor were SEIU 434B (with seventy-four thousand homecare and nursing home workers), SEIU 399 with forty-five thousand health care and other employees, and the United Teachers of Los Angeles (with thirty thousand teachers from the American Federation and the National Education Association).”  They have helped make Los Angeles a union city.  Their mission is to “ promote a voice for workers through organizing themselves into unions, building strong coalitions of labor, community, faith, and responsible businesses, engaging in both organizing and political campaigns, electing pro-union and pro-worker candidates and advancing public policies that support workers, families and local communities.”  They also encourage people to help make change by voting.  The Los Angeles County Federation of labor is a major focal point for new American labor movement.  Recently, the impressive progression of Los Angeles becoming a union city has become a stand out model for other non-union cities because of Los Angeles’ anti-union history.  Los Angeles combines the economic development activism and the refined political work of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor.",

She co-founded, with Ellen Gates Starr, an early settlement house in the United States, Chicago's Hull House that would later become known as one of the most famous settlement houses in America.  In an era when presidents such as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson identified themselves as reformers and social activists, Addams was one of the most prominent reformers of the Progressive Era.  She helped America address and focus on issues that were of concern to mothers, such as the needs of children, local public health, and world peace.  In her essay “Utilization of Women in City Government,” Jane Addams noted the connection between the workings of government and the household, stating that many departments of government, such as sanitation and the schooling of children, could be traced back to traditional women’s roles in the private sphere.  Thus, these were matters of which women would have more knowledge than men, so women needed the vote to best voice their opinions.  She said that if women were to be responsible for cleaning up their communities and making them better places to live, they needed to be able to vote to do so effectively.  Addams became a role model for middle-class women who volunteered to uplift their communities.  She is increasingly being recognized as a member of the American pragmatist school of philosophy, and is known by many as the first woman \"public philosopher in the history of the United States.  In 1889 she co-founded Hull House, and in 1920 she was a co-founder for the ACLU.  In 1931 she became the first American woman to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and is recognized as the founder of the social work profession in the United States.",

The book revealed that women fantasize, just as men do, and that the content of the fantasies can be as transgressive, or not, as men's.  The book, the first published compilation of women's sexual fantasies, refuted many previously accepted notions of female sexuality.",

The short-lived play ran only 13 performances and is best remembered today for the fact that each night Brando would run up and down a flight of stairs prior to an entrance to induce an effectively frenzied demeanor for one of the scenes.  The cast also included David Manners, to whom Brando has attributed much of his subsequent success, and Kevin McCarthy.  The play is noted for Brando's first major appearance on Broadway, during which he garnered attention for an unusually intense performance which presaged his later work on \"A Streetcar Named Desire\".  \"Truckline Cafe\" is also notable for being the first collaboration between Brando and Kazan, who later made \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"Viva Zapata\", and \"On the Waterfront\" together.  The play also remains notable for being the first time Brando and Malden worked together, prior to co-starring in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", \"On the Waterfront\", and \"One Eyed Jacks\".",

The company was established in 1846, when John Holly Knapp and William Wilson purchased half of interest in a lumber mill on the Red Cedar River from David Black; it was originally known as Black & Knapp.  Later Andrew Tainter acquired a quarter-interest, and the company has become Knapp-Tainter Lumber Company.  Henry Stout bought a quarter interest in the company in 1853, and its name became Knapp, Stout & Company.  The company's location allowed it to control the lumber industry in the region, and by 1870 it controlled the logging industry in the Red Cedar River valley.  In 1878, the company incorporated, and its official name became the Knapp, Stout & Co., Company.  The company employed over 2,000 workers in the Menomonie area and produced 85 million board feet of lumber on average yearly from 1871 to 1896; its output made it the largest lumber company in the world.  In the 1880s, the company expanded to sites along the Mississippi River, opening offices in Dubuque, Iowa, Read's Landing, Minnesota, and St. Louis.  By the 1900s, the company had largely depleted its lumber supply; it closed many of its camps and dissolved early in the 20th century.  The company sent out its last shipment of lumber on August 12, 1901.",

Founded by Peter Hamilton and Pippin Osborne in 1986 and originally based in Vancouver, British Columbia, Syncros had its heyday in the early 1990s as one of the earliest and most sought-after brands of high end aftermarket off-road bicycle parts.  In the late 1990s, the company had financial difficulties and was sold to the large U.S. based bicycle company GT.  Shortly thereafter, GT itself was purchased by Schwinn, which in turn was purchased by Pacific Bicycle Group, a large Taiwanese conglomerate known mainly for low end, mass market bicycles and parts.  Pacific was quick to try to capitalize on the Syncros brand name, and used the Syncros label on many cheaply produced OEM parts, severely damaging the brand's reputation.  Due to a lapse in trademark registration in the early 2000s, the Syncros brand name was briefly grabbed in the UK by Super Cycles of Nottingham.  However, a settlement was reached between Super Cycles and Pacific, resulting in Pacific regaining control of the brand name.",

    "text": "The towns and cities of the Hudson Valley were created by the U.S. state of New York as municipalities, in order to perform the services of local government.  In 1683, prior to the creation of modern towns, the Province of New York was divided into twelve counties for administrative purposes by the Colonial Governor of New York.  In the Hudson Valley, these divisions included Dutchess, Orange, and Ulster counties.  Dutchess and Orange remained unorganized until 1713, with Dutchess administered from Ulster; Orange would be administered from New York County.  Future counties would be formed and towns exchanged over time, with Rockland County split from Orange in 1799, at which time the southern towns of Ulster were transferred to Orange as compensation for the loss; and Putnam County from Dutchess in 1812, these county's towns can trace their origins to towns and precincts that were formed in their parent counties.  Another change that occurred was the transfer of Dutchess County's northern section, the Livingston Manor, to Columbia County.  Greene County was formed in 1800 by the combination of the southernmost towns of Albany County with the northernmost towns of Ulster.  The history of the towns of Greene and Columbia counties can be found at the Timeline of town creation in New York's Capital District.",

The song uses war as a metaphor in describing an argument and eventual reconciliation between a couple, with the woman emerging victorious and the narrator exclaiming, \"Oh, what a sweet surrender!\"  The song begins with the sound of drums mimicking the start of a battle march.  Despite Billy Sherrill's ambitious production and Jones' committed vocal performance, the single did not crack the Top 10, stalling at #16 and continued the singer's commercial slide as a solo artist.  Meanwhile, the single \"Golden Ring,\" a duet with his estranged ex-wife Tammy Wynette, became a #1 hit that same year.",

CSR policy functions as a self-regulatory mechanism whereby a business monitors and ensures its active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards and national or international norms. With some models, a firm's implementation of CSR goes beyond compliance and statutory requirements, which engages in \"actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law\".  The binary choice between 'complying' with the law and 'going beyond' the law must be qualified with some nuance.  In many areas such as environmental or labor regulations, employers can choose to comply with the law, to go beyond the law, but they can also choose to not comply with the law, such as when they deliberately ignore gender equality or the mandate to hire disabled workers.  There must be a recognition that many so-called 'hard' laws are also 'weak' laws, weak in the sense that they are poorly enforced, with no or little control or no or few sanctions in case of non-compliance.  'Weak' law must not be confused with soft law.  The aim is to increase long-term profits and shareholder trust through positive public relations and high ethical standards to reduce business and legal risk by taking responsibility for corporate actions.  CSR strategies encourage the company to make a positive impact on the environment and stakeholders including consumers, employees, investors, communities, and others.",

It featured the original Delia Derbyshire arrangement of Ron Grainer's theme tune and music by Malcolm Clarke from the 1972 serial \"The Sea Devils\", which was only the second to have an incidental score provided completely by the Radiophonic Workshop.  Most of the music included came from serials from the previous three years to demonstrate the recent composers' works.  For the album, each serial's incidental music was reassembled into short \"suites\" and although most of the music had been recorded in mono it was, for this compilation, remixed into stereo with sound effects added on to some tracks.  The album was re-released in 1992 by Silva Screen records as \"Earthshock - Classic Music From The BBC Radiophonic Workshop Volume 1\", with bonus tracks including \"The World of Doctor Who\", a track recorded by Mills as a B-side to Dudley Simpson's 1973 \"\"Moonbase 3\"\" single, which featured a mix of music from the serial \"The Mind of Evil\" with sound effects from \"Planet of the Daleks\" before finishing with Simpson's \"Master's Theme\".

    "text": "In the United Kingdom, the Royal Train is used to convey senior members of the British Royal Family and associated staff of the Royal Household around the railway network of Great Britain.  It is formed from a dedicated set of claret liveried sleeper, dining and lounge carriages.  The current stock dates from 1977-1987.  They are arranged according to requirements, and stored when not in use.  The earliest royal coaches date back to the mid-19th Century in the reign of Queen Victoria; until an upgrade in 1977 there were multiple sets based in different regions, a legacy of the pre-nationalisation era of railways in Britain.  Many are now in museums or on heritage railways; the National Railway Museum in York has a royal themed exhibition.  Dedicated locomotives have never traditionally been part of the Royal Train, first appearing in special livery only in the 1990s, but also seeing use on other trains since 2003.  In the 21st Century, various preserved (and one new build) steam locomotives have also hauled the train on special occasions.  Although regularly cited by critics as one of the unnecessary luxuries of the Royal Family, which has led to an increase in the alternate use of normal scheduled services where possible, supporters argue the current arrangement emphasizes utility over luxury, and is still often the most practical and secure mode of travel to fit the required itinerary and avoid disruption to the public.",

    "text": "\"Jesuit Ivy\" is the title of a commencement speech delivered at Boston College, a Jesuit university in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, United States.  The term was coined in a 1956 commencement address by then-Massachusetts Senator John F. Kennedy.  Speaking at the Jesuit university, he was likely making reference to the Ivy League, an athletic conference established in 1954.  The term \"Jesuit Ivy\" was somewhat of a contradiction in terms.  The Ivy League's members were generally Protestant-founded institutions; Boston College had itself been founded in part because Catholics were being denied admission to Harvard University in the nineteenth century.  The nickname suggested both Boston College's rising stature and the declining prevalence of discrimination at elite American universities.  Kennedy, a Catholic whose family were longtime Boston College benefactors, graduated from Harvard in 1940; as did his father in 1912, and his brothers Joe Jr, Robert and Edward in 1938, 1948 and 1956 respectively.",

Like all Massachusetts villages, Chestnut Hill is not an incorporated municipal entity.

Chestnut Hill's borders are roughly defined by the 02467 ZIP Code.  Chestnut Hill is not a topographical designation; the name refers to several small hills that overlook the 135-acre (546,000 m) Chestnut Hill Reservoir rather than one particular hill.

It was the most famous of several spa baths opened in Leamington between the late-18th and mid-19th centuries.  People would travel from throughout the country, and indeed Europe, to benefit from treatments using the town's healing waters.  When 'taking the waters' became less fashionable after the mid-19th century the Pump Rooms became Leamington's only surviving spa facility, later also being extended to include the town's public swimming pool.  After a major redevelopment in 1997-99 the building now houses \"Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum\", a public library, a Tourist Information Centre, cafe and assembly rooms.",

It is currently the governing party, having been so since the 2010 general election, where a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats was formed.  In 2015, the Conservatives led by David Cameron won a surprise majority and formed the first Conservative majority government since 1992.  However, the 2017 snap election on Thursday 8 June resulted in a hung parliament, and the Conservatives lost their parliamentary majority.  They are reliant on the support of a Northern Irish political party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), in order to command a majority in the House of Commons through a confidence-and-supply deal.  The party leader, Theresa May, has served as both Leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister since 13 July 2016.  It is the largest party in local government with 9,237 councillors.  The Conservative Party is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United Kingdom, the other being its modern rival, the Labour Party.

He often portrayed impoverished \"campesinos\" or a peasant of \"pelado\" origin.

He works primarily on hip hop music, and has produced or co-produced for artists Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal.  Wells is also the son of Motown singer Mary Wells and musician/songwriter, Cecil Womack.  Being the son of Motown legend Mary Wells may have helped jumpstart Meech Wells' career, but the West Coast rap producer quickly proved his talent and eventually aligned himself with Snoop Dogg, another relationship that definitely didn't hurt his career.  Before being Snoop's producer of choice during the late 1990s and early 2000s, Wells began his career as part of a funk band called Trey Lewd that also featured Tracey Lewis, George Clinton's son; this provided him with the opportunity to work with Clinton himself.  By 1993, Wells found himself working alongside producer/rapper Def Jef; the two's production on Shaquille O'Neil's \"I Got Skillz\" (a surprise hit single) won them instant credentials.  Throughout the mid-'90s, he continued to hone his craft, working on a number of remix projects before eventually being introduced to Snoop through a friend.  Before long, the two were working together as a potent duo, beginning with \"Still a G Thang,\" one of the better songs on Snoop's Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told.  Wells produced a few No Limit songs featuring Snoop—Tru's \"It's a Beautiful Thang,\" Silkk the Shocker's \"Get It Up\"—before playing a major role in bringing a West Coast sound to Snoop's Top Dogg album in 1999: \"In Love With a Thug,\" \"Better Days,\" \"Gangsta Ride,\" among others.  In 2000 he reprised his role as one of Snoop's producers of choice, producing tracks for Tha Eastsidaz' self-titled debut and Doggy's Angels' Pleezbalevit, as well as Snoop's own Tha Last Meal (\"Go Away,\" \"Issues\").",

It is around 9 km long (north to south), 4 km wide (east to west) and 1 km wide at its narrowest point.  Its distance from the local port of Sihanoukville is 25 km (beeline) and 23 km (beeline) from the Serendipity/Ochheuteal beach pier.  The word \"Sanloem\" translates to: 1.  drowsiness and to: 2.  far out and hard to discern, in a wider sense.  Inconsistencies on how to spell the island's name in its Latinized version date back to the 19th century.  The first controversial spelling variants were issued by map makers during French rule.  Alternatives have since become widespread and are in common usage.  Often confusion ensues as Google Maps offers the phonetically most consistent variant, whereas Google Search redirects to an alternative.",

The trauma unit at first consisted of two beds, and was later expanded to four beds.  Many people called the four-bed unit the \"death lab.\"  Cowley was the creator of the \"Golden Hour\" concept, the period of 60 minutes or less following injury when immediate definitive care is crucial to a trauma patient's survival.  He was a leader in the use of helicopters for medical evacuations of civilians, beginning in 1969, and founded the Society of Thoracic Surgeons.  He also founded the nation's first statewide EMS system, called MIEMSS by Executive Order of Maryland's Governor Mandel, 1972, as well as the National Study Center for Trauma and EMS, enacted by Congress in 1986 and signed into law by President Ronald Reagan.  He is also known for being one of the first surgeons to perform open-heart surgery and invented both a surgical clamp that bears his name and a prototype pacemaker that was used by Dwight D.

The Fortean Society was primarily based in New York City.  Its first president was Theodore Dreiser, an old friend of Charles Fort, who had helped to get his work published.  Founding members of The Fortean Society included Tiffany Thayer, Booth Tarkington, Ben Hecht, Alexander Woollcott (and many of NYC's literati such as Dorothy Parker), and Baltimore writer H. L. Mencken.  Other members included Vincent Gaddis, Ivan T. Sanderson, A. Merritt, Frank Lloyd Wright and Buckminster Fuller.  The first 6 issues of the Fortean Society's newsletter \"Doubt\" were each edited by a different member, starting with Theodore Dreiser.  Tiffany Thayer thereafter took over editorship of subsequent issues.  Thayer began to assert extreme control over the society, largely filling the newsletter with articles written by himself, and excommunicating the entire San Francisco chapter, reportedly their most active, after disagreements over the society's direction, and forbidding them to use the name Fortean.  During World War II, for example, Thayer used every issue of \"Doubt\" to espouse his politics.  Particularly, he frequently expressed opposition to Civil Defense, going to such lengths as encouraging readers to turn on their lights in defiance to air raid sirens.  In contrast to the spirit of Charles Fort, he not only dismissed flying saucers as nonsense, but also dismissed the atomic bomb as a hoax.",

They released a lot of material, particularly the full-length album, \"The Gospel According to the Studdogs\" and the 7\" vinyl 3-song EP, and gained local and national notoriety.  They were featured in several national music magazines, including Magnet and Amplifier.  Comparisons were made to the Stooges, Dead Boys, and it was said they sounded \"like absolute victory by way of slurring, Rolling Stones-y garage rock from nowhere in particular.\"  Their drunken, abrasive live shows often ended with someone bleeding or being thrown out of the venue.  Their live shows were said to be \"what Howling Wolf would sound like through a wall of noise and distortion.\"  The band was signed by Orange Recordings in Los Angeles and toured all over the country, sharing bills with the Demolition Doll Rods, Bob Log III, The Fleshtones, and Immortal Lee County Killers and a one-time show with the Suicide Girls Burlesque Tour in Orlando.  While in the Studdogs, Rich Evans began promoting concerts under the tag \"Mutiny Productions\".  He now heads the independent \"Florida's Dying\" label, promoting and releasing material from the Florida-underground music scene.  Kyle Justin joined the band on drums in early 2002 to replace Jason, who was moving to Texas.  Kyle vacated his position as drummer in 2003 to pursue a music career in Los Angeles.

Shortly after Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton died (having been the 1977 recipient himself), the award was renamed to honor his legacy as a humanitarian.  Each year, a winner is selected from 32 nominees from the 32 different teams.  A panel of judges, which includes the Commissioner of the NFL, Connie Payton (widow of Walter Payton), the previous year's winner, and a number of former players select the winner of the award.  The Man of the Year winner receives a $50,000 donation in his name to a charity of his choice.  The other 31 finalists also receive donations in their name of $5,000 each to charities of their choice.  The Chicago Bears and Kansas City Chiefs have had more winners of the award than any other team, with 5 winners each.  The winners for the 2016 award are New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald.",

She was one of the writers for the television series \"Bewitched\", and helped a group of Jefferson High School students write the episode \"Sisters at Heart\".  She also wrote for \"Executive Suite\" and \"Fish\", a 1977-78 spin-off from \"Barney Miller\".  With Barbara Corday, Avedon created \"Cagney & Lacey\", the world's first dramatic television series to place women in both of its starring roles.  They came up with the idea for this television series after having read Molly Haskell's book \"From Reverence to Rape\" which stated that there had never been a female buddy film.  Avedon and Corday initially intended \"Cagney & Lacey\" to be a film.  While they were writing the series together, Avedon was more experienced and proficient in screenwriting than Corday, and Avedon mentored Corday in this area throughout the series.  They were best friends for nearly a decade.",

It was created in 1658 for John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, a Royalist supporter during the English Civil War, of the Bruton branch of the Berkeley family.  He was a descendant of Sir Maurice de Berkeley (14th century), younger son of Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley (see Baron Berkeley).  Charles Berkeley, 2nd Viscount Fitzhardinge, was his brother and Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth, his nephew.  Lord Berkeley of Stratton's second son, the third Baron (who succeeded his elder brother), was an Admiral in the Royal Navy.  He died without surviving children and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Baron.  He was a politician and served as First Lord of Trade between 1714 and 1715.  On his death the title passed to his eldest son, the fifth Baron.  He was also a politician and held office as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard and Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-Pensioners.  He was childless and the title became extinct on his death in 1775.",

    "text": "The title Baron Berkeley originated as a feudal title and was subsequently created twice in the Peerage of England by writ.  It was first granted by writ to Thomas II de Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley (1245–1321), 6th feudal Baron Berkeley, in 1295, but the title of that creation became extinct at the death of his great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron by writ, when no male heirs to the barony by writ remained, although the feudal barony continued.  The next creation by writ was in 1421, for the last baron's nephew and heir James Berkeley.  His son and successor William was created Viscount Berkeley in 1481, Earl of Nottingham in 1483, and Marquess of Berkeley in 1488.  He had no surviving male issue, so the Marquesate and his other non-inherited titles became extinct on his death in 1491, whilst the barony passed \"de jure\" to his younger brother Maurice.  However William had disinherited Maurice because he considered him to have brought shame on the noble House of Berkeley by marrying beneath his status to Isabel, daughter of Philip Mead of Wraxhall, an Alderman and Mayor of Bristol.  Instead he bequeathed the castle, lands and lordships comprising the Barony of Berkeley to King Henry VII and his heirs male, failing which to descend to William's own rightful heirs.  Thus on the death of King Edward VI in 1553, Henry VII's unmarried grandson, the Berkeley inheritance returned to the family.  Therefore, Maurice and his descendants from 1492 to 1553 were \"de jure\" barons only, until the return of the title to the senior heir Henry (and indirectly to his mother Anne), becoming \"de facto\" 7th Baron in 1553.  Upon his death he was succeeded by his relative George Harding.",

Unfortunately, the primitive construction of the canal allows almost 50 percent of the water to escape en route, creating lakes and ponds along the canal, and a rise in groundwater leading to widespread soil salinization problems.

The lyrics were written by Eric Bloom and British science fiction writer Michael Moorcock from the viewpoint of Elric, Moorcock's most famous character.  Elric wields a sentient, soul-sucking sword named Stormbringer.  Aside from a set of cryptic, blood-red runes on the blade, the sword is black, hence the name \"Black Blade\".  The music was jointly composed by Eric Bloom, lead singer of Blue Öyster Cult, and bass-player John Trivers.  The song was featured in the Blue Öyster Cult album \"Cultösaurus Erectus.\"  When Bloom was asked how he got in touch with Moorcock for the song he claims, \"I went out of my way to send him a Fan Boy letter.  He was living in England, and he came over to America, to meet with his publisher.  He said, “Let's get together.”  We got together, and bonded, and he started sending me lyrics.

About the relation between northeastern Iberian and southeastern Iberian scripts, it is necessary to point out that they are two different scripts with different values for the same signs; however it is clear that they had a common origin and the most accepted hypothesis is that northeastern Iberian script derives from southeastern Iberian script.  In fact, the southeastern Iberian script is very similar, both considering the shape of the signs or their values, to the Southwestern script used to represent an unknown language usually named Tartessian.  The main difference is that southeastern Iberian script doesn’t show the vocalic redundancy of the syllabic signs.  Unlike the northeastern Iberian script the decipherment of the southeastern Iberian script is not yet complete, because there are a significant number of signs on which scholars have not yet reached a consensus.  Despite it is believed that unlike the northeastern Iberian script the southeastern Iberian script doesn’t show any system to differentiate between voiced and unvoiced occlusives, a recent paper (Ferrer i Jané 2010) defends the existence of a dual system also in the southeastern Iberian script.",

Cripps was sent to negotiate an agreement with the nationalist leaders, speaking for the majority Hindu population, and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, speaking for the minority Muslim population.  Cripps worked to keep India loyal to the British war effort in exchange for a promise of full self-government after the war.  Cripps promised to give dominion status after the war as well as elections to be held after the war.  Cripps discussed the proposals with the Indian leaders and published them.  Both the major parties, the Congress and the League rejected his proposals and the mission proved a failure.  Cripps had designed the proposals himself, but they were too radical for both Churchill and the Indians; no middle way was found.  Congress moved towards the Quit India movement whereby it refused to cooperate in the war effort, while the British imprisoned practically the entire Congress leadership for the duration of the war.
