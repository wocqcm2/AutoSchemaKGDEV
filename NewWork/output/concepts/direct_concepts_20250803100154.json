The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle epitomized by its eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. It is set in the fictional town of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society and television, and many aspects of the human condition. The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987 and after a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became a hit series for Fox. The growing popularity of the series motivated video game developers to create video games based on the series. Two pinball machines have also been produced; one self-titled, that was only made available for a limited time after the first season finale (1990) and \"The Simpsons Pinball Party\" (2003). Additionally, several handheld device games have been released, such as \"Bartman: Avenger of Evil\" (1990) and \"Bart Simpson's Cupcake Crisis\" (1991).", "extracted_concepts": {"concepts": [{"name": "The Simpsons", "type": "entity", "abstraction_level": "specific", "description": "An American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company.", "related_concepts": ["Matt Groening", "Fox Broadcasting Company", "Homer", "Marge", "Bart", "Lisa", "Maggie", "Springfield", "The Tracey Ullman Show", "animated television sitcom", "satirical parody", "video games", "pinball machines", "handheld device games"]}, {"name": "Matt Groening", "type": "entity", "abstraction_level": "specific", "description": "The creator of 'The Simpsons', who conceived the family and named characters after his own family members.", "related_concepts": ["The Simpsons", "James L.
