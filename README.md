# AutoSchemaKG: A Knowledge Graph Construction Framework with Schema Generation and Knowledge Graph Completion

This repository contains the implementation of AutoSchemaKG, a novel framework for automatic knowledge graph construction that combines schema generation via conceptualization. The framework is designed to address the challenges of constructing high-quality knowledge graphs from unstructured text.

This project uses the following paper and data:

*   **Paper:** [Read the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23628)
*   **Full Data:** [Download the dataset](https://hkustconnect-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jbai_connect_ust_hk/EgJCqoU91KpAlSSOi6dzgccB6SCL4YBpsCyEtGiRBV4WNg) (onedrive)
*   **Neo4j CSV Dumps:** [Download the dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AlexFanWei/AutoSchemaKG) (huggingface dataset)

### Update
- (05/07) Update with batch generation and refactor the codebase. Add PDF-md-json instruction. [See PDF support](#pdf-support)
- (24/06) Add: ToG, Chinese KG construction (refer to example_scripts for KG construction with different language). Separate NV-embed-v2 transformers dependency.

## AutoSchemaKG Overview

AutoSchemaKG introduces a two-stage approach:
1. **Knowledge Graph Triple Extraction**: Extract triples comprising entities and events from text by using LLMs 
2. **Schema Induction**: Automatically generate schema for the knowledge graph by using conceptualization and create semantic bridges between seemingly disparate information to enable zero-shot inferencing across domains


The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across different domains.

## ATLAS Knowledge Graphs

ATLAS (Automated Triple Linking And Schema induction) is a family of knowledge graphs created through the AutoSchemaKG framework, which enables fully autonomous knowledge graph construction without predefined schemas. Here's a summary of what ATLAS is and how it works:

### Key Features of ATLAS Knowledge Graphs

- **Scale**: Consists of 900+ million nodes connected by 5.9 billion edges
- **Autonomous Construction**: Built without predefined schemas or manual intervention
- **Three Variants**: ATLAS-Wiki (from Wikipedia), ATLAS-Pes2o (from academic papers), and ATLAS-CC (from Common Crawl)

The project is organized into several key components:
- `atlas_rag/`: Core package containing the main functionality
- Evaluation directories for different aspects of the system
- Database-related scripts and API hosting
- Example notebooks demonstrating usage
- Import and distribution directories for data management

## Install atlas-rag through pip
```bash
pip install atlas-rag
```
To support NV-embed-v2, install the transformers package with the version constraint >=4.42.4,<=4.47.1 by running:
```bash
pip install atlas-rag[nvembed]
```

### KG Construction with ATLAS

```python
from atlas_rag.kg_construction.triple_extraction import KnowledgeGraphExtractor
from atlas_rag.kg_construction.triple_config import ProcessingConfig
from atlas_rag.llm_generator import LLMGenerator
from openai import OpenAI
from transformers import pipeline
# client = OpenAI(api_key='<your_api_key>',base_url="<your_api_base_url>") 
# model_name = "meta-llama/llama-3.1-8b-instruct"

model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
client = pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_name,
    device_map="auto",
)
keyword = 'Dulce'
output_directory = f'import/{keyword}'
triple_generator = LLMGenerator(client, model_name=model_name)
kg_extraction_config = ProcessingConfig(
      model_path=model_name,
      data_directory="example_data",
      filename_pattern=filename_pattern,
      batch_size_triple=3, # batch size for triple extraction

      max_new_tokens=2048,
      max_workers=3,
      remove_doc_spaces=True, # For removing duplicated spaces in the document text
)
kg_extractor = KnowledgeGraphExtractor(model=triple_generator, config=kg_extraction_config)

# Construct entity&event graph
kg_extractor.run_extraction() # Involved LLM Generation
# Convert Triples Json to CSV
kg_extractor.convert_json_to_csv()
# Concept Generation

## Large Knowledge Graph Hosting and Retrieval Augmented Generation

This repository provides support for hosting and implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) over our constructed knowledge graphs: `ATLAS-wiki`, `ATLAS-pes2o`, and `ATLAS-cc`. For detailed instructions on hosting and running these knowledge graphs, please refer to the `atlas_billion_kg_usage.ipynb` notebook. 

## Building New Knowledge Graphs and Implementing RAG

The `atlas_full_pipeline.ipynb` notebook demonstrates how to:
- Build new knowledge graphs using AutoschemaKG
- Implement Retrieval Augmented Generation on your custom knowledge graphs


## Multi-hop Question Answering Evaluation

To replicate our multi-hop question answering evaluation results on benchmark datasets:
- `MuSiQue`
- `HotpotQA` 
- `2WikiMultiHopQA`

Please follow the instructions in the `atlas_multihopqa.ipynb` notebook, which contains all necessary code and configuration details.

## General Evaluation


The framework includes comprehensive evaluation metrics across three dimensions:
- Knowledge Graph Quality  (`EvaluateKGC`)
- Factual Consistency on FELM (`EvaluateFactuality`)
- General Performance on MMLU (`EValuateGeneralTask`)

Detailed evaluation procedures can be found in the respective evaluation directories.

    extensions: [".pdf"]  # Only process PDF files
    recursive: true       # Whether to recursively process subfolders
